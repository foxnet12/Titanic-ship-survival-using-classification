#                                                             Predict the survival from the Titanic ship disaster


The objective of this project is to forecast the likelihood of passenger survival using a specific dataset. Essential data is sourced from the Kaggle competition titled Titanic.

## Work steps:

1. Import necessary algorithms.

2. Combine train and test datasets.

3. Fill the missing values.

4. Encoding categorical variables.

5. Split the training data set.

6. Separate feature and target variables.

7. Split into train and validation sets.

8. select the Random forest classifier algorithm.

9. Train the data and predict the result.

10. measure the accuracy with a result of 82 percent.
